    Allows users to specify the verify_ca path for the corresponding driver
    through the ``verify_ca`` option under the ``[<driver>]`` section in the configuration.
    When ``[driver_info]/<driver>_verify_ca`` is specified as None or True,
    it will be replaced by the value of the ``verify_ca`` option.
    NOTE: For the ``idrac`` driver, it uses the same options as the ``redfish`` driver.
